<h1>Researching Themes</h1>
Before starting this project I wanted to determine a theme beforehand to do this I have to do research on how other portfolio's colour theme's go about things as a darkish colour scheme is nice but at same time blending colours won't look as nice in addition to this going for darker colour limits things we can use depending on how it's approached to do this there's collection of portfolio's on a Github repository.

Research

Portfolio #1 this portfolio was able to blend a darkish theme at the start and light theme at the end however in my opinion this
seemed a bit dull like it could of been improved as if it was missing something key but I just couldn't quite understand what it was

Research #2

Portfolio #2 With the portfolio's I'm picking them at random to see how they implement other peoples name's into portfolio which
start with different characters to see how they work with characters and other things this is so I cna understand what's the
Do's and Don'ts of web development.

In this 2nd portfolio he allows the individual to select a colour theme between dark mode suited and light mode suited web
site this allows the users own customization of the website so they can read it how they feel comfortable to read it.
It uses small hover animations which are not gradual but more instant I don't like this for design I'm going to go for
I'm going to use more gradual transitions which feel more comforting on the eyes.

Also in this case the portfolio uses more sharp font's which feel as if they're targeted at individuals which may
struggle with reading so it helps words stand out. His title for welcome developer's I feel like isn't my style
or theme aspect to go for the letter spacing between the comma and other word doesn't feel like something appealing
to the theme I'm going for.

Research #3

This portfolio was in league of it's own with design it matched in animations, smooth effects and other aspects
in addition to this the layout of elements was neat and not cluttered. The design was amazing it had nice hover animations to
follow the mouse in certain areas this was also able to blend colours perfectly.

The fonts was huge for titles while also remaining clear and nice to read it kept the topbar from being cluttered
spreading the elements side-to-side. It also show's timeline of work the author has done without too big boxes or
overly big text it matches a nice font style. Using the sans-serif font family.
